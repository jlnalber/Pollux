# Pollux

Make graphs and calculate things in such a graph.

## About the code:

There are several namespaces:

Pollux: hosts the general application with its windows etc.

Pollux.Properties: Is the home of the settings and other stuff.

Pollux.Graph: This namespace contains classes that keep the data of a graph and is fully seperate from the other namespaces for later use.
